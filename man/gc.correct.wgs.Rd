\title{Function to correct LogR for waivyness that correlates with GC content}
\usage{
gc.correct.wgs(Tumour_LogR_file, outfile, correlations_outfile,
  gc_content_file_prefix, chrom_names)
}
\arguments{
\item{Tumour_LogR_file}{String pointing to the tumour LogR output}

\item{outfile}{String pointing to where the GC corrected LogR should be written}

\item{correlations_outfile}{File where correlations are to be saved}

\item{gc_content_file_prefix}{String pointing to where GC windows for this reference genome can be
found. These files should be split per chromosome and this prefix must contain the full path until
chr in its name. The .txt extension is automatically added.}

\item{chrom_names}{A vector containing chromosome names to be considered}
